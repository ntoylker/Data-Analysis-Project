# Data Analysis Project: The Effect of TMS on Epileptic Discharges

This repository contains the MATLAB code and analysis for the "Data Analysis" course project, completed in December 2024.

---

## üìù Project Overview

This project investigates the effectiveness of **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**, a non-invasive method, in mitigating the effects of epileptic discharges (EDs). The core hypothesis is that applying TMS during an ED can reduce its total duration. A key research question is whether the timing of the TMS application‚Äîspecifically the delay from the onset of an ED (`preTMS`)‚Äîinfluences the remaining duration of the discharge (`postTMS`).

The analysis is performed on a dataset collected at the Laboratory of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, 3rd Neurology Clinic of AUTH, which combines EEG and TMS measurements from epileptic patients.

## üìä The Dataset

The data is provided in the `TMS.xlsx` file, containing 254 observations of epileptic discharges. Of these, 135 are control measurements (without TMS) and 119 are measurements where TMS was applied.

The dataset includes the following variables:

| Variable     | Description                                                                 |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TMS`        | Binary indicator: `1` if TMS was applied, `0` otherwise.                  |
| `EDduration` | Total duration of the epileptic discharge (in seconds).                     |
| `preTMS`     | Time from the start of the ED to the TMS application (in seconds).        |
| `postTMS`    | Time from the TMS application to the end of the ED (in seconds).          |
| `Setup`      | Measurement condition code (1-6), representing a different session/patient. |
| `Stimuli`    | The number of stimuli in a single TMS application.                          |
| `Intensity`  | Intensity of the stimulation as a percentage of the maximum.                |
| `Spike`      | Timing of the first stimulus relative to the ED peak (-1, 0, or 1).         |
| `Frequency`  | Frequency of the stimuli in a TMS application.                              |
| `CoilCode`   | Type of TMS coil used: `1` for figure-eight, `0` for round.               |

## üéØ Project Objectives

The project is structured around a series of analytical tasks designed to explore the dataset from different statistical perspectives:

1.  **Probability Distribution Analysis**: Find the best-fit parametric probability distributions for `EDduration` with and without TMS and compare them graphically.

2.  **Goodness-of-Fit Testing**: Use resampling techniques (1000 random samples) to test if the `EDduration` data follows an exponential distribution for different coil types and compare the results with the standard parametric $\chi^{2}$ test.

3.  **Hypothesis Testing & Confidence Intervals**: For each of the 6 `Setup` conditions, test whether the mean `EDduration` is equal to the overall population mean. This involves using parametric tests for normally distributed data or bootstrap methods otherwise.

4.  **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between `preTMS` and `postTMS` within each `Setup`. Both parametric (Student's t-statistic) and non-parametric randomization tests will be performed and compared.

5.  **Simple Linear & Polynomial Regression**: Model the relationship between `EDduration` and the experimental `Setup` to determine if the measurement condition is a significant predictor.

6.  **Multiple Linear Regression & Feature Selection**: Develop a multiple regression model to predict `EDduration` using experimental parameters as predictors (`Setup`, `Stimuli`, `Intensity`, etc.). This task involves comparing a full model against models derived from **Stepwise Regression** and **LASSO** feature selection methods. The impact of a variable with missing values (`Spike`) will also be assessed.

7.  **Model Validation**: Evaluate the predictive performance of the regression models from the previous step by splitting the data into training and testing sets and calculating the mean squared error on the test set.

8.  **Advanced Regression Models**: Extend the multiple regression analysis by including `preTMS` as a predictor and comparing the performance of Stepwise, LASSO, and **Principal Component Regression (PCR)** models.

## üìà Results and Conclusions

This section summarizes the key findings from the analysis, based on the executed MATLAB scripts.

### 1. Probability Distribution of ED Duration

* **Best Fit**: After testing 20 different continuous probability distributions, the **Exponential distribution** was found to provide the best fit for the `EDduration` data in both cases: with and without TMS application.
* **Effect of TMS**: While the probability density functions (PDFs) for both datasets appear similar, the histograms reveal a key difference. The application of TMS appears to reduce the occurrence of long-duration EDs, causing a higher concentration of discharges at shorter durations.

---

### 2. Goodness-of-Fit for Exponential Distribution (by Coil Type)

The analysis tested whether the `EDduration` follows an exponential distribution for the two different TMS coil types.

* **Figure-Eight Coil (`CoilCode = 1`)**: Both the resampling method and the standard parametric $\chi^{2}$ test confirmed that the data **does follow an exponential distribution**. The null hypothesis could not be rejected.
* **Round Coil (`CoilCode = 0`)**: For this coil type, both tests concluded that the data **does not follow an exponential distribution**. The null hypothesis was rejected.

The results from both the resampling and parametric methods were consistent for each coil type.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing of Mean ED Duration for Each Setup

The mean `EDduration` for each of the 6 `Setup` conditions was compared against the overall mean duration ($\mu_0$). The results are summarized below:

| Setup | TMS Condition | Follows Normal Dist.? | Decision on Mean $\mu_0$ | Method Used |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| 1     | No TMS        | No                    | **Accept** (Œº‚ÇÄ is in CI)     | Bootstrap           |
| 2     | No TMS        | No                    | **Accept** (Œº‚ÇÄ is in CI)     | Bootstrap           |
| 3     | No TMS        | (N < 10)              | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 4     | No TMS        | No                    | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 5     | No TMS        | No                    | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 6     | No TMS        | (N < 10)              | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 1     | With TMS      | Yes                   | **Accept** (Œº‚ÇÄ is in CI)     | Parametric (t-test) |
| 2     | With TMS      | No                    | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 3     | With TMS      | Yes                   | **Accept** (Œº‚ÇÄ is in CI)     | Parametric (t-test) |
| 4     | With TMS      | No                    | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |
| 5     | With TMS      | Yes                   | **Accept** (Œº‚ÇÄ is in CI)     | Parametric (t-test) |
| 6     | With TMS      | (N < 10)              | **Reject** (Œº‚ÇÄ not in CI)    | Bootstrap           |

The outcomes for the "With TMS" and "No TMS" cases agree for Setups 1, 4, and 6, but differ for Setups 2, 3, and 5. It is worth noting that the results for setups with very small sample sizes (e.g., Setup 3 and 6 without TMS) may not be fully representative.

### 4. Correlation Between `preTMS` and `postTMS`

The analysis investigated the correlation between the time before TMS (`preTMS`) and the time after (`postTMS`) for each of the 6 setups.

* **Overall Finding**: For all 6 setups, both the parametric test (Student's t-statistic) and the randomization test concluded that the null hypothesis **cannot be rejected**. This indicates that there is **no statistically significant linear correlation** between `preTMS` and `postTMS`.
* **Note on Setup 4**: Although the null hypothesis was not rejected for Setup 4, its p-value was close to the 0.05 significance level, which might hint at a weak, but not statistically significant, correlation.
* **Test Reliability**:
    * For **Setups 2 and 4**, which have larger sample sizes (>30), the **parametric test** is considered more reliable.
    * For **Setups 1, 3, 5, and 6**, which have smaller sample sizes, the **randomization test** is the more trustworthy method.

### 5. Simple & Polynomial Regression (EDduration vs. Setup)

The analysis explored the relationship between `EDduration` and the experimental `Setup`.

* **Linear Model**: A simple linear regression model was initially fitted for both the "with TMS" and "without TMS" datasets.
    * The model fit the **"with TMS" data better** than the "without TMS" data, as indicated by a higher R¬≤ value.
    * However, in both cases, the R¬≤ values were quite low, suggesting that a simple linear model is **not sufficient** to capture the relationship between `EDduration` and `Setup`.

* **Polynomial Model**: To improve the fit, a 4th-degree polynomial regression model was applied.
    * This extension proved to be very useful. The polynomial model achieved a **significantly better fit** for both datasets, with the adjusted R¬≤ values being much closer to 1. This indicates that the relationship between `EDduration` and `Setup` is non-linear.

---

### 6. Multiple Linear Regression & Feature Selection

This task aimed to find the best predictive model for `EDduration` when TMS is applied, using several experimental parameters as predictors. Three types of models were compared: a full multiple linear regression model, a model derived from **Stepwise Regression**, and one from the **LASSO** method. The analysis was performed twice: once including the `Spike` variable and once without it.

* **Analysis With the `Spike` Variable**:
    * When including all predictors, the **LASSO model performed the best**. It achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest adjusted R¬≤, indicating a superior fit to the data compared to the full and stepwise models.

* **Analysis Without the `Spike` Variable**:
    * The `Spike` variable contains many missing values. The analysis was repeated after removing it entirely.
    * **This approach yielded better results**. Although the MSE increased slightly (due to using a larger dataset, as fewer rows were discarded), the **adjusted R¬≤ value improved for all three models**.
    * This indicates that the `Spike` variable does not contribute positively to the model's predictive power and that **ignoring it leads to a better overall model fit**.

---

### 7. Model Validation on Training and Test Sets

To evaluate the real-world predictive power of the models from question 6, the dataset was split into a 75% training set and a 25% test set. The `Spike` variable was excluded from this analysis based on previous findings.

* **Scenario 1: Using Pre-selected Variables**
    * The models were trained on the new training set but kept the same variables that were originally selected using the *full* dataset.
    * When evaluated on the test set, the **Stepwise model demonstrated the best predictive performance**, achieving the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE).

* **Scenario 2: Retraining the Models**
    * The Stepwise and LASSO models were retrained from scratch on the training set, allowing them to perform feature selection on this smaller dataset.
    * Once again, the **Stepwise model performed best on the test set**, showing the lowest MSE.

The results did not change significantly between the two scenarios. This suggests that the variables selected by the Stepwise model are robust and generalize well, even when trained on a smaller subset of the data.

### 8. Advanced Regression Models with `preTMS` and `postTMS`

The analysis was extended by adding `preTMS` and `postTMS` as potential predictors and comparing the performance of the full linear model, Stepwise, LASSO, and Principal Component Regression (PCR).

* **Adding `preTMS` as a Predictor**
    * The inclusion of `preTMS` improved the fit (adjusted R¬≤) for both the LASSO and Stepwise models compared to the models in question 6.
    * The **Stepwise model delivered the best performance** of the four.
    * The PCR model, configured to explain 99% of the variance, performed better than LASSO and the full linear model but was not as effective as the Stepwise model.

* **Adding `postTMS` as a Predictor**
    * When `postTMS` was also included, the performance of **all models improved dramatically**, with adjusted R¬≤ values approaching 1.
    * This result is expected, as `EDduration` is by definition the sum of `preTMS` and `postTMS` when TMS is applied. The models effectively learned this linear relationship (`EDduration ‚âà preTMS + postTMS`).
    * This confirms that `postTMS` is the single most important predictor for `EDduration`, and all models‚Äîincluding the dimensionality reduction techniques‚Äîsuccessfully adapted to prioritize this variable, leading to a near-perfect fit.
